This repository contains a simple offline game "Plotter Connect" written in Python with Pygame. The goal is to connect randomly generated points in order. It's a lightweight game you can enjoy without an internet connection.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `pygame` library (install via `pip install pygame`)

## Running the game

```bash
python game/plotter_game.py
```

When you run the script, a window will appear with several dots. Click each dot in order. Lines will connect the dots as you progress. When all dots are connected, a new pattern appears.
